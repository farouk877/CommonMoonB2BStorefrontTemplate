                                    Every two quarters, we partner with a different nonprofit organization to 
                                    select a campaign that aligns with our mission. Our responsibility is to 
                                    creatively fundraise in support of these campaigns. Currently, Project 
                                    Break The Cycle’s main fundraising streams are external merchandise sales 
                                    and internal corporate matching programs. In our merchandise sales, we 
                                    design and market unique lines of clothing where 100% of profits are 
                                    donated to our active campaign (visit our <a href="/shop">Shop</a>). 
                                    In our corporate programs, 
                                    our corporate partners match all employee donations several times over. 
                                    All donations over the duration of an active campaign (two quarters) go 
                                    towards that specific campaign.

                                “The idea of Project Break The Cycle started when our group of friends noticed a lack of transparency in fundraising initiatives from large nonprofit organizations. Back in highschool, our Humanitarian Club would always have fundraisers for NPOs with global footprints, but we never actually understood where our money went. We combined our hobbies in fashion and needs for organizational transparency to create Project Break The Cycle - an organization leveraging creative fundraising mechanisms to empower other proven, transparent, and relevant NPO’s. After our initial Cherry Blossom sweatshirt sale, we developed a network of people wanting to support meaningful causes but also receive a piece of memorabilia in return. And we haven’t looked back since.” - Farouk Marhaba, Founder</p>
