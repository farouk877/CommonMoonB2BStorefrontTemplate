                                        We realize that education is the driving force for individuals to sustainably break free from intergenerational poverty. A better education provides better job opportunities that pay higher salaries, thus allowing individuals to better support their families and escape the cycle of poverty. In Lebanon, political conflicts have devastated public school systems, rendering private school as the only means of obtaining a thorough education. Currently, the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare (HTSW), an orphanage in Tripoli, Lebanon, only has the funding to send 7 of its 55 children to private school. Project Break The Cycle aims to raise that number and provide more children with the opportunity to seek better education.

                                        To reach our goal, weâ€™ve partnered with HTSW to organize a scholarship pool where funds will be allocated for private school tuition, private after-school tutors, books, and other school supplies. Our goal is to provide a $10,000 education fund for HTSW. The allocation details can be found below.
