                                    Project Break The Cycle is excited to announce our relaunch! We’ve been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work to clarify our mission and form new corporate relations. Below, we will address key points about our organization, and some exciting new changes that were made!
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text">
                                    At Project Break The Cycle, we aspire to break the cycle of poverty by using creative fundraising mechanisms to empower reputable and transparent nonprofit organizations that provide humanitarian intervention in the Middle East. In other words, we’re a nonprofit for nonprofits, helping them fundraise in ways they haven’t done before by tapping into unexplored revenue streams. We’ve established a community wanting to support transparent nonprofits while in return receiving amazing products to display their support.
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text causes__text2">
                                    Every two quarters, we partner with a different nonprofit organization to select a campaign that aligns with our mission. Our responsibility is to creatively fundraise in support of these campaigns. Currently, Project Break The Cycle’s main fundraising streams are external merchandise sales and internal corporate matching programs. In our merchandise sales, we design and market unique lines of clothing where 100% of profits are donated to our active campaign (Link shop here). In our corporate programs, our corporate partners match all employee donations several times over. All donations over the duration of an active campaign (two quarters) go towards that specific campaign. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text">
                                    To address supply chain inefficiencies within our merchandise sales model, Project Break The Cycle will shift to a made-to-order model, working with suppliers and manufacturers based in the United States. Once a supporter purchases a piece of merchandise, they should expect to receive their order in 1-3 weeks, as every item is made to order - but we promise, it’ll be worth it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text">
                                    We’re also excited to launch an Artists for PBTC program, where local artists can submit their designs for near-future merchandise! In exchange for their support to Project Break The Cycle’s mission, they will be receiving social media spotlight, press releases, credit on every piece of merchandise produced, and free merchandise! Be on the lookout for more details about this program soon!
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text causes__text2">
                                    Project Break The Cycle is also organizing an Ambassador Program for individuals interested in promoting our merchandise. In exchange for their unique marketing and promotional skills being used for good, we’ll send them free merchandise so they can show their audience how amazing the different pieces are! More details to come in a separate update.
                                    </p>
