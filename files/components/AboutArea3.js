                                    The idea of Project Break The Cycle started when a tight-knit group of friends 
                                    consistently noticed a lack of transparency in fundraising initiatives from 
                                    large nonprofit organizations.  What started out as a way to combine our hobbies 
                                    in fashion design and business management eventually led to Project Break The Cycle - 
                                    a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that leverages creative fundraising mechanisms to 
                                    empower other reputable and transparent NPOs. During our premiere Cherry Blossom 
                                    sweatshirt sale, we developed a network of supporters that empathized with our cause 
                                    and promoted the PBTC mission. And we havenâ€™t looked back since.
